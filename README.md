flog
=======================

A webapp to track employees' fitness progress for a workplace wellness initiative

(Based on the [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) boilerplate)


<!--
Notes
======

When setting the app up for the first time, you'll have to make sure that you
have a working MongoDB instance with a database named 'flog'. You'll also need
to give the user in the environment's MONGODB_URI (see .env file) root
privileges (via the admin database).
